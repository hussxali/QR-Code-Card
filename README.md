# QR-Code-Card

My first ever project :)
Not tutorial based.

The good: classes, fonts 
The bad: structuring the card(tried with position, floats, didnt work well) Flex was a chllange.
The need work on: Need to review the flex basics, imrpove my practice on it. How to align structure elements.

If you have any tips or comments, please share
Happy coding
